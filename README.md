# Core Functionality of the Calculator
# The advanced calculator was implemented leveraging a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) to facilitate the direct interaction with the calculator. The calculator supports arithmetic operations (Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide, and Hello command), management of calculation history, and access to extended functionalities through dynamically loaded plugins.

# Plugin Systems Applicability
# This calculator creates a flexible plugin system to allow seamless integration of new commands or features. This system dynamically loads and integrates plugins without modifying the core application code. This system also includes a REPL "Menu" command to list all available plugin commands, ensuring user discoverability and interaction.

# The calculator leverages Pandas to manage a robust calculation history, enabling users to load, save, clear, and delete history records through the REPL interface.
